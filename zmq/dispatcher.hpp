    //  Dispatcher implements bidirectional thread-safe ultra-efficient
    //  passing of commands between N threads.
    //
    //  It's designed to encapsulate all the cross-cutting functionality
    //  between two different threads. Namely, it consists of a pipe to pass
    //  commands and signaler to wake up receiver thread when new commands
    //  are available.
    //
    //  Note that dispatcher is inefficient for passing messages within a thread
    //  (sender thread = receiver thread) as it performs unneccessary atomic
    //  operations. However, given that within-thread message transfer
    //  is not a cross-cutting functionality, the optimisation is not part
    //  of the class and should be implemented by individual threads.
