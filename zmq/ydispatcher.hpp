    //  Dispatcher implements bidirectional thread-safe ultra-efficient
    //  passing of objects between N threads.
    //
    //  It's designed to encapsulate all the cross-cutting functionality
    //  between two different threads. Namely, it's the pipe to pass messages
    //  and signaler to wake up receiver thread from sender thread.
    //
    //  Note that dispatcher is inefficient for passing messages within a thread
    //  (sender thread = receiver thread) as it performs unneccessary atomic
    //  operations. However, given that within-thread message transfer
    //  is not a cross-cutting functionality, the optimisation is not part
    //  of the class and should be implemented by individual threads.
