This directory contains a simple example of sending raw video from a webcam
over 0MQ.

To build the code you need to have the SDL development libraries
(libsdl1.2-dev in Debian) and the Unicap library from
http://www.unicap-imaging.org/ installed. This example does not use
autoconf at the moment, so to build just type "make".

You also need to have 0MQ installed in /usr/local (or modify the Makefile 
to point to it's libraries/header files).

TODO:

- figure out why unicap sometimes fails to open the video device
- figure out why ucil_convert_buffer sometimes fails
- send patch to upstream to fix ucil.h for C++
- autoconf
